Shows observed tiles so you don't have to manually count in long games.

BUGS:

- [ ] As tiles shift from recently drawn to hand; the count flickes
- [ ] Honor tiles in the player meld zone sometimes count again next game (visibility issue)

TODO:
- [ ] Show available/disqualified yaku
- [ ] Actually make a struct for all the Emj addon junk (🙂)
- [ ] Save game logs after confirming ability to order plays
- [ ] han/fu calculations?
